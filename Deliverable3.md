# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format, so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling "Gymoranda"

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Natel Whitaker

**Git Master**: Dylan White

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Finish implementing all features, ensure data persistence and interoperability across program, and polish the user interface.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  15

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We added 9 User Stories to our board this Sprint.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We chose these User Stories because they add functionality that we deemed most important and beneficial to our project. We selected these 9 because
> we now have a better grasp of what our team can accomplish in a Sprint and we believe that 
> they collectively require the exact amount of effort we're able to deliver with other course 
> requirements as the semester wraps up.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These fit well with our Sprint goal because they put the finishing touches on features we 
> committed to delivering by tying together the last of our classes that need to share data,
> structuring our data in a more efficient manner, and making our user interface look professional and ready to hit the market.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Your Answer

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Your Answer

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Your Answer


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Your Answer

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Your Answer

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Your Answer

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Your Answer

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Your Answer

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> Your Answer

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> Your Answer

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Your Answer

**Starting in Sprint 2**
Include a screenshot of your Burndown chart here and analyse in detail for me why it looks the way it does and how you could improve it if it needs improving. 

![Sprint 3 Burndown](images/sprint3Burndown.png)
> Our trend line isn't as spot on as it was in our previous sprint. We used the relative mass 
> approach for US scoring again but this time we had the extra variable of multiple big 
> end-of-semester requirements from all of our courses competing for our attention in addition 
> to final exams. We intentionally pushed ahead at the start of the sprint to ensure we finished 
> the minimum amount of features we wanted to see implemented, and then consistently worked over 
> the remainder of the sprint. Overall we did end up completing all of our US on time and given 
> the nature of everyone's schedule and conflicting requirements, our team is extremely happy

**Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project 
(give a short answer).  

Yes, I think I contributed a fair amount of effort to this sprint. Like my teammates, I 
front-loaded a lot of effort knowing this final week would be a bit crazy, made some commits in 
the middle, and then had another big push at the end of the sprint to wrap things up.
